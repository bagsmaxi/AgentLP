Higher bin step = more volatile pair\n- LPs deposit into a range of bins and earn fees only when price is in their range\n- Single-sided deposits: you deposit only SOL on one side of the active price\n\n## Strategy Types\n- Spot (ID 0): Uniform distribution. Best for stable/low-vol pairs (binStep 1-5). Bin width: 40-60\n- Curve (ID 1): Bell curve around active price. Best for medium-vol pairs (binStep 6-30). Bin width: 20-30\n- BidAsk (ID 2): Concentrated on one side. Best for high-vol/memecoins (binStep 31+). Bin width: 10-20\n\n## Pool Health Evaluation\nPositive: High volume relative to liquidity, consistent fees, reasonable APR, deep liquidity\nWarning: APR >1000% with low volume (dead/manipulated), liquidity <$5K (rugpull risk), volume spike then decline (pump & dump)\n\nYou MUST always respond with ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no extra text. Analyze these Meteora DLMM pools and select the best one for SOL LP farming.\n\nASSISTED MODE: Balance safety and returns. Prefer established tokens with consistent volume and deep liquidity.\n\nPool candidates (pre-filtered, all SOL-paired):\n[\n  {\n    \"address\": \"BGm1tav58oGcsQJehL9WXBFXF7D27vZsKefj4xJKD5Y\",\n    \"name\": \"SOL-USDC\",\n    \"binStep\": 10,\n    \"volume24h\": 25453427,\n    \"fees24h\": 24483.83,\n    \"feeApr\": 0.41,\n    \"liquidity\": 5917867,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.5826\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"GyQ8vs9Cg5cxvu6ukYv7CAjiQidXvjs29PCaNBQRshaz\",\n    \"name\": \"RATHBUN-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 1413644,\n    \"fees24h\": 40049.82,\n    \"feeApr\": 278.4,\n    \"liquidity\": 14386,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.5541\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"BtRbG3BUEEcB4NWUqgQKMgNykzk9KML3dP3Mwmg96v5T\",\n    \"name\": \"MooNutPeng-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 722528,\n    \"fees24h\": 20332.77,\n    \"feeApr\": 207.2,\n    \"liquidity\": 9813,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.3484\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"v2RNaW1C365LhRY5zHizhwgWuEWatqfDX74FCr1RMKt\",\n    \"name\": \"TOLY-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 440588,\n    \"fees24h\": 12147.57,\n    \"feeApr\": 215.69,\n    \"liquidity\": 5632,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2904\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"4vsSmGK8FjqGdUGAdrSrUgu5x77a2FPPPrMyAPWb7hhW\",\n    \"name\": \"hoodrat-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 100,\n    \"volume24h\": 677898,\n    \"fees24h\": 16439,\n    \"feeApr\": 123.73,\n    \"liquidity\": 13286,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2564\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"DKbhY96Hcx9nAnhsCPaZgpcaqMGRiVWHkBkmdUMZWunZ\",\n    \"name\": \"soluna-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 952494,\n    \"fees24h\": 16811.55,\n    \"feeApr\": 55.91,\n    \"liquidity\": 30070,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.216\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"81GpCm4d13y8TozYtThabuSCLQN2o3bbrvDogXFPn8sA\",\n    \"name\": \"HYPE-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 20,\n    \"volume24h\": 3555939,\n    \"fees24h\": 6781.26,\n    \"feeApr\": 0.42,\n    \"liquidity\": 1615755,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.1609\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"HbjYfcWZBjCBYTJpZkLGxqArVmZVu3mQcRudb6Wg1sVh\",\n    \"name\": \"PUMP-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 20,\n    \"volume24h\": 3031581,\n    \"fees24h\": 5778.45,\n    \"feeApr\": 0.43,\n    \"liquidity\": 1331897,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.1434\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"5MqZ1FjFwAQb6EnXFaLisNznvd9KT2Jo4ovkJW7n4P4F\",\n    \"name\": \"DEW-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 125,\n    \"volume24h\": 125852,\n    \"fees24h\": 7677.41,\n    \"feeApr\": 64.28,\n    \"liquidity\": 11944,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.1395\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"CFC6n181TdaxSZWNxYH5MmoLsVAf2V94bzWSbdhu8TgH\",\n    \"name\": \"SKR-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 20,\n    \"volume24h\": 2991930,\n    \"fees24h\": 5931.13,\n    \"feeApr\": 1.48,\n    \"liquidity\": 399807,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.1292\n  }\n]\n\nRespond with ONLY this JSON structure:\n{\"selectedPoolAddress\":\"address\",\"selectedPoolName\":\"NAME\",\"ranking\":[{\"address\":\"...\",\"name\":\"...\",\"aiScore\":0.85,\"reasoning\":\"brief\"}],\"reasoning\":\"1-2 sentence summary\",\"riskLevel\":\"low|medium|high|extreme\",\"confidence\":0.85}\n"}

Higher bin step = more volatile pair\n- LPs deposit into a range of bins and earn fees only when price is in their range\n- Single-sided deposits: you deposit only SOL on one side of the active price\n\n## Strategy Types\n- Spot (ID 0): Uniform distribution. Best for stable/low-vol pairs (binStep 1-5). Bin width: 50-70\n- Curve (ID 1): Bell curve around active price. Best for medium-vol pairs (binStep 6-30). Bin width: 35-50\n- BidAsk (ID 2): Concentrated on one side. Best for high-vol/memecoins (binStep 31+). Bin width: 25-42\n\n## Volume Momentum\n- volumeMomentum 0-1 measures how active a token is right now (4h volume vs 24h ratio)\n- momentum >= 0.7 = HOT (very active, trending) → widen bin range by ~40% to stay in range\n- momentum >= 0.4 = RISING (moderately active) → widen bin range by ~20%\n- momentum < 0.4 = CALM → use base bin range\n- For trending tokens, ALWAYS recommend wider ranges to avoid going out of range quickly\n\n## Pool Health Evaluation\nPositive: High volume relative to liquidity, consistent fees, reasonable APR, deep liquidity\nWarning: APR >1000% with low volume (dead/manipulated), liquidity <$5K (rugpull risk), volume spike then decline (pump & dump)\n\nYou MUST always respond with ONLY valid JSON.

Prefer established tokens with consistent volume and deep liquidity.\n\nPool candidates (pre-filtered, all SOL-paired):\n[\n  {\n    \"address\": \"BGm1tav58oGcsQJehL9WXBFXF7D27vZsKefj4xJKD5Y\",\n    \"name\": \"SOL-USDC\",\n    \"binStep\": 10,\n    \"volume24h\": 25413805,\n    \"volume4h\": 1588516,\n    \"volume1h\": 505250,\n    \"fees24h\": 24450.34,\n    \"fees4h\": 1524.38,\n    \"feeApr\": 0.41,\n    \"liquidity\": 5983144,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.13,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.5995\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"GyQ8vs9Cg5cxvu6ukYv7CAjiQidXvjs29PCaNBQRshaz\",\n    \"name\": \"RATHBUN-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 1426551,\n    \"volume4h\": 51656,\n    \"volume1h\": 4265,\n    \"fees24h\": 40395.84,\n    \"fees4h\": 1438.95,\n    \"feeApr\": 271.88,\n    \"liquidity\": 14858,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.07,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.5652\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"BtRbG3BUEEcB4NWUqgQKMgNykzk9KML3dP3Mwmg96v5T\",\n    \"name\": \"MooNutPeng-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 666565,\n    \"volume4h\": 23373,\n    \"volume1h\": 7566,\n    \"fees24h\": 18626.73,\n    \"fees4h\": 534.15,\n    \"feeApr\": 250.34,\n    \"liquidity\": 7441,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.07,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.3797\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"BoeMUkCLHchTD31HdXsbDExuZZfcUppSLpYtV3LZTH6U\",\n    \"name\": \"JitoSOL-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 1,\n    \"volume24h\": 467985,\n    \"volume4h\": 228068,\n    \"volume1h\": 90,\n    \"fees24h\": 44.49,\n    \"fees4h\": 21.67,\n    \"feeApr\": 0,\n    \"liquidity\": 2997177,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.97,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2512\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"FQJ3goAawrwGatZU3T4FincBCkBrHft6iJsRFiUb7ns8\",\n    \"name\": \"LIZARD-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 100,\n    \"volume24h\": 107790,\n    \"volume4h\": 40219,\n    \"volume1h\": 6083,\n    \"fees24h\": 6557.17,\n    \"fees4h\": 2336.76,\n    \"feeApr\": 57.07,\n    \"liquidity\": 11489,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.75,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2414\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"4vsSmGK8FjqGdUGAdrSrUgu5x77a2FPPPrMyAPWb7hhW\",\n    \"name\": \"hoodrat-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 100,\n    \"volume24h\": 700490,\n    \"volume4h\": 59264,\n    \"volume1h\": 16713,\n    \"fees24h\": 16933.61,\n    \"fees4h\": 1340.15,\n    \"feeApr\": 33.71,\n    \"liquidity\": 50238,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.17,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2212\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"5MqZ1FjFwAQb6EnXFaLisNznvd9KT2Jo4ovkJW7n4P4F\",\n    \"name\": \"DEW-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 125,\n    \"volume24h\": 133877,\n    \"volume4h\": 19776,\n    \"volume1h\": 3347,\n    \"fees24h\": 8127.89,\n    \"fees4h\": 1110.29,\n    \"feeApr\": 94.03,\n    \"liquidity\": 8644,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.3,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2097\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"A7a34F2JFCbTcnGHDm9PTf6E2RQihJvR4L5VHCdf74KW\",\n    \"name\": \"NATIONS-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 100,\n    \"volume24h\": 52558,\n    \"volume4h\": 52558,\n    \"volume1h\": 52558,\n    \"fees24h\": 1596.31,\n    \"fees4h\": 1596.31,\n    \"feeApr\": 11.66,\n    \"liquidity\": 13690,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 1,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2087\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"DKbhY96Hcx9nAnhsCPaZgpcaqMGRiVWHkBkmdUMZWunZ\",\n    \"name\": \"soluna-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 853629,\n    \"volume4h\": 17218,\n    \"volume1h\": 3729,\n    \"fees24h\": 15250.89,\n    \"fees4h\": 208.99,\n    \"feeApr\": 54.55,\n    \"liquidity\": 27959,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 0.04,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.2083\n  },\n  {\n    \"address\": \"3Lag9t434L1Ru3KEcZ6Z92GxDADaw1CUp9G5EeesLdUc\",\n    \"name\": \"OPENCLAW-SOL\",\n    \"binStep\": 80,\n    \"volume24h\": 10665,\n    \"volume4h\": 5427,\n    \"volume1h\": 1497,\n    \"fees24h\": 280.75,\n    \"fees4h\": 143.32,\n    \"feeApr\": 4.58,\n    \"liquidity\": 6134,\n    \"volumeMomentum\": 1,\n    \"ruleBasedScore\": 0.1957\n  }\n]\n\nRespond with ONLY this JSON structure:\n{\"selectedPoolAddress\":\"address\",\"selectedPoolName\":\"NAME\",\"ranking\":[{\"address\":\"...\",\"name\":\"...\",\"aiScore\":0.85,\"reasoning\":\"brief\"}],\"reasoning\":\"1-2 sentence summary\",\"riskLevel\":\"low|medium|high|extreme\",\"confidence\":0.85}\n"}
